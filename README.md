## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and
push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This
will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures
all group members are working with the same repository.

Note that you must compile your readme (this document) for it to
properly display as part of your github repository.

Once you have received feedback on your project proposal (via Canvas)
you may alter this README so that it describes your final project
instead of the project proposal.

## Data Set


**dataset link**:https://github.com/stat850-unl/project-dist/raw/master/SAP2020_merged_v1.xls

The dataset is the agronomic traits that were measured in a sorghum field experiment with two levels of nitrogen treatment and around 400 genotypes. Hopefully we will also find the sub-population information of these genotypes as an additional categorical attribute.

## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set

We could explore the relationship between categorical data and numeric phenotypes, as well as between different phenotypes.

- We can check the distributions of numeric attributes using box plots and historgrams.
- We can explore the effect of the nitrogen treatment by plotting the data. We expect that nitrogen deficiency will influence the dimension of the leaves, for example leaf length and width, and also we can check if it has the impact on plant height.
- We can visualize the potential spatial effect on plant growth, indicated by plant height or flowering time, by plotting the field row and column layout and color-coding with the phenotypes.
- We can investigate the relationship between plant phenotypes, for example plotting 2d histograms and scatterplots bewtween each two agronomic traits.
