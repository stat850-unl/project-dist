## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and
push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This
will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures
all group members are working with the same repository.

Note that you must compile your readme (this document) for it to
properly display as part of your github repository.

Once you have received feedback on your project proposal (via Canvas)
you may alter this README so that it describes your final project
instead of the project proposal.

## Data Set

## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set

We can explore the influence of the treatment by ploting the data. Like if lack of nitrogen will influence the dimension of the leafs for example it's length and width. Also we can check if it has the impact on plant height.
